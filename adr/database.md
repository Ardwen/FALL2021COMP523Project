# Database Choice

## Summary

Summary - In order to store data persistently, we decided to use firebase.

## Problem
Problem - What problem do you need to solve? Describe the context of the problem. Why is it a problem? Why is it important to solve? Imagine writing to a classmate on another team. What would you need to tell them for them to understand the problem?

We need to store both user's personal informamtion as well as the log data of their interaction with the quiz game. 

Security

Admin side data

## Constriants
**Constraints** - Are there any kinds of possible solutions that are out of bounds for this project? For example, if the client isn’t willing to pay for a solution, that’s worth noting. Or perhaps solutions that only work on MacOS aren’t something the whole team can work with. Capture the constraints, as well as the reason for the constraints, here. Also capture any assumptions you’re making about what the client might want or not want.

Available funding
Type of data, privacy data, sentitive data
Real-time constraint, certain speed
How much time you have for development, maybe don't quite want to start from scratch
